# Hey Alex :)

Here is my React Native application based on the requirements you've specified in your email. All of my source code is in the `src` directory. I also added README documentation for all of the design philosophies I've put into place in case you're also curious about it. I also put inline comments.

# How to run the application

First, clone the repo.

Then, run `npm i`. I'm using node version v16.16.0 for this application.

Run `expo start` to run locally on your phone (using the Expo Go app). I've been using expo for years, and I highly recommend using it.

# Some notes

- If something breaks due to dependency version inconsistency (highly unlikely) and you need to use version v16.16.0, I recommend using node version manager (nvm) to change your node version instead of going through the arduous process of trying to uninstall and reinstall node on your machine (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
